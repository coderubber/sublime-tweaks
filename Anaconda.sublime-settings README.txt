These are some sensible override for default settings of anaconda sublime package.
Use these settings values in >Preferences >Package settings >Anaconda >Settings - User

Anaconda is a package which makes sublime a nice python IDE

This are the settings I use for my sublime on Linux Mint.
Some may have to specify the location of your python package.
Mine is in the default location of /usr/bin/python and so I didn't have to override those.
